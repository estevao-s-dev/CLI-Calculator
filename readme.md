When learning a language for the first time I always like to start with a calculator to get a hang of the basics and syntax.

This is a Simple fully functioning CLI Calculator. Next step will be exploring GUI C libraries and develop a complete calculator desktop experience.

To test it, just copy the code and compile it to run on your OS.
